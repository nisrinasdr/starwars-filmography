# Overview
This is just a documentation of my learning progress. The web shows the data fetched from [https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/](SWAPI GraphQL API).

# Tools
## What I implemented in this personal project:
- CSS in JS using [https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction](Emotion)
- Fetching GraphQL API using [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v2/get-started/](Apollo Client)
- Testing using [https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react](Jest) and [https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/](React-Testing-Library)
