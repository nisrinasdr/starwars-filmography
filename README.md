# Overview
This is just a documentation of my learning progress. The web shows the data fetched from [SWAPI GraphQL API](https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/).

# Tools
## What I implemented in this personal project:
- CSS in JS using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
- Fetching GraphQL API using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v2/get-started/)
- Testing using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
